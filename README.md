# UYD Stitcher

I use [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/) to listen to my favourite podcast, [Uhh Yeah Dude](https://uhhyeahdude.com/).

This script uses BeautifulSoup to get the URL for the latest episode because whatever combination of Firefox plugins I use makes the latest episode play button on Stitcher's website not work.

Maybe this could be useful to automatically check for episodes, since the UYD upload schedule is not solid.

Seatbelts.
